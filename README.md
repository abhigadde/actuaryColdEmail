# actuaryColdEmail
This is some code I made that will automatically go through the actuarial directory, input your given options in fields such as location and designation and then return the list of all the users. Ideally, it would be in a nice excel format but I am still working on that. Then I can put this into a mail merge and send personalized emails to 100s of actuaries at once. Its great, isn't it?

Outline on what to do
1. Open actuarial directory (use classic search)
2. Enter location and designation in
3. Search and pull table output into python
4. For each value see if I can click on name link and get email value as well

NEXT STEPS for me to continue this code onto
1. Automate to run through all 4 designations
2. See if can make it run faster (get rid of any refreshes possibly?)
3. Output to a csv file or something else nice looking

*Note: if you do choose to use this code please change the file directory location for the chrome driver

Did this using jupyter notebooks in Anaconda and Python
