# actuaryColdEmail
This is some code I made that will automatically go through the actuarial directory, input your given options in fields such as location and designation and then return the list of all the users. Ideally, it would be in a nice excel format but I am still working on that. Then I can put this into a mail merge and send personalized emails to 100s of actuaries at once. Its great, isn't it?

*Note: if you do choose to use this code please change the file directory location for the chrome driver
